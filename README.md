# Convergence analysis of particle swarm optimization using stochastic Lyapunov functions and quantifier elimination
We present a computational procedure for stability analysis of particle swarm optimizer (PSO) and show that this approach leads to an extension of previously known stability regions for PSO under stagnation assumptions.
